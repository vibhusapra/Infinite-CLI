# Infinite CLI
Infinite CLI is a self-extending terminal where any command you can imagine can exist—if it doesn’t, Codex generates an ephemeral tool on the fly, runs it safely, and leaves behind only the artifacts. Treat code as disposable by default, and “pin” the commands that earn a permanent place in your workflow.
